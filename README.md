# Rust SDK for Numaflow

This SDK provides the interface for writing [User Defined Sources](https://numaflow.numaproj.io/user-guide/sources/user-defined-sources/),
[User Defined Source Tranformers](https://numaflow.numaproj.io/user-guide/sources/transformer/),
[UDFs](https://numaflow.numaproj.io/user-guide/user-defined-functions/user-defined-functions/) 
and [User Defined Sinks](https://numaflow.numaproj.io/user-guide/sinks/user-defined-sinks/) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
